        <span class="subtitle">Redesigning Laundry Practices</span>

        <p><div><span class="subtitle-2">A literature review on international laundry practices and notions of cleanliness, culminating the design of speculative off-grid, sustainable laundry practice.</span></p></div>

        <div class="rk-item item-1 rk-size-12 description">
        <p>Notions of cleanliness vary globally. Often, feelings of cleanliness are entangled in "freshness", which is often a product of the visual and sensory experience surrounding the practice of doing laundry and the relative state of clothing before and after the laundry process. In places like the United Kingdom and the United States, laundry practices are mechanically resource and energy intensive. Despite this, for some communities in Brazil where handwashing is more common, relative cleanliness ratios may be higher. This suggests an easier ability to achieve a feeling of subjective "freshness", which seems to be a more reliable marker of satisfaction in cleanliness, rather than an objective measure of foreign particles or contamination on a piece of clothing itself.
          <p>Among numerous factors, the often labour intensive laundry process, compared to mechanically intensive processes, where items are hand-washed and thus incorporate various stimulating factors, can lead to effectively pleasurable experiences of percieved higher effort compared to the automated mechanical process of laundry practices in "westernised" communities. Various other stimuling factors, in contrast to the sanitised, "lab-like" spaces in other laundry spaces, can contribute to an overall feeling of freshness where positive sensory experiences are entwined with the laundry process itself.</p>
          <p> This project had two halfs. The first half, a breaching experiment, explored alternatives to conventional laundry practices. An analyis of the efficacy of various practices led to a deeper examination of the most effective. This led to the second half of the project – theoretical development of micro-bubble and CO2 acidified laundry system via nature-based mechanisms to replicate satisfactory feelings of freshness in an otherwise off-grid system where resources of some forms may be reduced. The methodology of this second half involving placing the speculative design process within a fictional scenario of social collapse, where manuals for off-grid technologies are circulated to surviving populations from the remaining government. This enables the design of laundry practices for future need and thus for resilience in the present.</p>
